    # Introduction to Machine Learning

    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

    ## Types of Machine Learning

    ### 1. Supervised Learning
    Supervised learning is where you have input variables (X) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.

    ### 2. Unsupervised Learning
    Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data.

    ### 3. Reinforcement Learning
    Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

    ## Key Concepts

    - **Algorithm**: A set of rules or instructions given to an AI, neural network, or other machine to help it learn on its own.
    - **Training Data**: The dataset used to teach a machine learning algorithm.
    - **Feature**: An individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed.
    - **Model**: The output of an algorithm after training on a dataset.
