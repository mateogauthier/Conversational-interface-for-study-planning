# Machine Learning Study Guide

## Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Goal: Learn mapping from inputs to outputs
- Examples: Classification, Regression

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Uses unlabeled data
- Goal: Discover hidden patterns
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality reduction

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Agent learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Examples: Game playing, robotics

## Key Algorithms

### Linear Regression
- Simple and interpretable
- Good baseline model
- Assumes linear relationship

### Random Forest
- Ensemble method
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Robust to overfitting

### Neural Networks
- Can model complex patterns
- Requires large datasets
- Many hyperparameters to tune

## Important Concepts

**Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
**Cross-validation**: Technique to assess model generalization
**Feature engineering**: Creating new features from existing data
**Bias-variance tradeoff**: Balance between underfitting and overfitting
